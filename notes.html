react is a js library from fb

redux is an extra layer on top of react that deals with STATE management

lesson library https://github.com/iamshaunjp/react-redux-complete-playlist
go to the branch master for the lesson you are working on

react = components like:
nav bar
search
footer
then react injects the components into the DOM thru the Virtual DOM
when the ui STATE for a component changes,
react updates just that component to the virtual dom
then it updates the actual DOM

react uses jsx (which looks like html) that holds STATE
