react is a js library from fb

redux is an extra layer on top of react that deals with STATE management

lesson library https://github.com/iamshaunjp/react-redux-complete-playlist
go to the branch master for the lesson you are working on

react = components like:
nav bar
search
footer
then react injects the components into the DOM thru the Virtual DOM
when the ui STATE for a component changes,
react updates just that component to the virtual dom
then it updates the actual DOM

react uses jsx (which looks like html) that holds STATE

how to create a react component?
use js classes (classes are a way to create a blue-print objects in js)
or
xxx

this script tag in the head --
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js"></script>
allows us to create react components

EVERY react CLASS BASED component must have ONE function in it called RENDER(){} that RETURNS a value
this renders the tempate to the div on the html
you can ONLY return ONE thing so wrap it in a div and return the div which can contain
multiple elements... h1, h2, p, etc...

this script tag in the head --
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
allows us to take a classed based component and stick it in the DOM
via ReactDOM.render(
<param1 />, param2('xxx'));
ex.
ReactDOM.render(
<App />, document.getElementById('app'));
to output DYNAMIC content, try <p>{ }</p>

jsx limitations
only return ONE root element - like a div
that returned element can not have a css "CLASS=''" but yo ucan use className="xxx"

Component State is a js object that describes the data or ui-state
You can also define state in a constructor method

CREATE REACT APP is a command line tool to create react apps
with a dev server
uses E6S
keeps code modular
access to dev tools to optimize code
HOW?
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start

The public folder holds the index.html
- The src folder holds all of the code
- the App.js folder is the root compentent that is rendered to the html
- additional components are NESTED in the root component
All component names START WITH A CAP. parent and child components
WHY? b/c you can control "state" easier in components
PROPS allow you to pass data from the component to the child (properties)

2 type of components - Container and UI
- CONTAINER components hold state, not concerned with ui, lifecycle hooks and use classes to create
-- uses the class keyword w/render return
- UI components don't contain state, do receive data from props, use functions to create
-- uses the const keyword (a fat arrow function)
